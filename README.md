[![](https://vueschool.s3.amazonaws.com/b03ac260f400ae0aafcc8132ef1b802f/vuex-for-everyone.jpeg)](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuex-for-everyone)

This repository contains the example code for the [Vuex for Everyone](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuex-for-everyone) course.

In this course you'll learn all there is to know about Vuex by creating a shopping cart from scratch.

We will start off by creating a shopping cart with Vue and then progressively dive into Vuex features as we need them. Piece by piece we'll replace parts of our application with mutations, getters, and actions.

You'll also learn how to break your Vuex store into modules.

After this course, you will know when and how to use getters, mutations, actions and, how to split your Store with modules.

The course is free. [Enroll at Vue School!](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuex-for-everyone)
